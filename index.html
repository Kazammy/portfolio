    <h2>About me</h2>
    <h3>My background</h3>
     <p class="me">My full name is <strong>Samuel Wambugu Thige.</strong>I completed my Secondary Education last year and since then I've done a short course on Microsoft Packages.</p>
     <p class="decs">I made the choice to do programmming because i really want to know coding plus i always love hackers they seem fun i'd like to be one.Another factor that influenced my decision to come here was the course which I am going to do in university <em>Computer Science</em>.The last reason is that I had free time.</p>
